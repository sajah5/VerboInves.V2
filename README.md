**VerboInves - Digital Forensics Tool (Version 2)**

VerboInves is a digital forensics tool designed to investigate Word files, providing advanced analysis features that enhance security assessments. This is the second version of the project, which now includes the ability to download reports in multiple formats upon completion of the verification process. The tool includes capabilities like metadata extraction, VBA code detection, hash calculation, and content analysis.

### Features:
- **Metadata Extraction**: Extracts essential metadata such as filename, author, creation date, modification date, size, and more.
- **VBA Code Detection**: Detects and analyzes VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) code within Word files, helping to identify potential security risks.
- **Hash Calculation**: Verifies file integrity by calculating hash values (e.g., MD5, SHA-1) for the document.
- **Content Analysis**: Conducts a detailed examination of document contents, identifying keywords, extracting artifacts, and providing insights into the document's structure.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Available in both Arabic and English, ensuring accessibility for a diverse audience.
- **API Integration**: Combines C# for the user interface and Python for backend functionality, ensuring efficient communication and seamless integration.
- **Multiple Report Formats**: Allows users to download the analysis reports in various formats (e.g., DOCX, PDF, HTML, TXT) once the verification process is complete.
